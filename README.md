## Idea
* **My Quiz app is a web-based platform that allows users to take quizzes on different programming languages, so they can train their knowledge and engage in discussion through a forum and live chat features. The app is built using several popular web development technologies including React.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, MySQL, Firebase, and Sequelize.Here you can find out which programming language would fit you.**

## Front-End and design
* **React.js is used as the front-end framework to build the user interface and ensure smooth and responsive interactions between the app and users. The use of React.js also enables easy componentization and management of the different sections of the app.Bootstrap is used as the CSS framework to style the app and ensure it is responsive across different devices and screen sizes.Using almost every essential function that React.js framework gives you for clean code and easier solution to your poblem.**

## Back-End
* **Express.js is used as the server-side framework for handling API requests and database interactions. It provides a simple and flexible way to handle routing, middleware, and other server-side functionalities.Sequelize is used as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to provide a simple and efficient way to interact with the MySQL database. It enables easy creation and management of database models, as well as handling of database migrations.**
* **Authentication is made with React Context and Firebase's features, it also provides Google sign in method, this way you can easily sign up in the website.
### Databases

* **Firebase is used as a backend service for real-time data synchronization and storage. It provides an easy way to manage user authentication and authorization, as well as a range of tools for data storage, messaging, and analytics.**

## Summary 
**Overall, your Quizz app with forum and live chat is a powerful and user-friendly platform that provides a seamless experience for users to take quizzes and engage in discussion with others to exchange knowledge.
